# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I am feeling better about it now. I still definitely need to spend more independent time getting familiar with what we've learned so far.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Honestly, it was rough. It took me quite a while to wrap my head around what to do this time. I had both types of struggle, but I also think my struggles were ultimately fruitful.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I just have to get more comfortable with the different concepts. At the rate I'm doing my work today, I don't foresee myself needing to adjust my calendar for it.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Again, I'm not sure if I even have "questions" necessarily; I just need more time with the content to internalize/normalize it in my head, so it feels less clunky when I interact with for statements.
